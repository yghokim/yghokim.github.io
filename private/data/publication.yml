This work explores the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in addressing these challenges. We present PlanFitting, an LLM-driven conversational agent that assists users in creating and refining personalized weekly exercise plans. By engaging users in free-form conversations, PlanFitting helps elicit users’ goals, availabilities, and potential obstacles, and enables individuals to generate personalized exercise plans aligned with established exercise guidelines. Our study—involving a user study, intrinsic evaluation, and expert evaluation—demonstrated PlanFitting’s ability to guide users to create tailored, actionable, and evidence-based plans. We discuss future design opportunities for LLM-driven conversational agents to create plans that better comply with exercise principles and accommodate personal constraints.},

            abstract = {As minimally verbal autistic (MVA) children communicate with parents through few words and nonverbal cues, parents often struggle to encourage their children to express subtle emotions and needs and to grasp their nuanced signals. We present AACessTalk, a tablet-based, AI-mediated communication system that facilitates meaningful exchanges between an MVA child and a parent. AACess-Talk provides real-time guides to the parent to engage the child in conversation and, in turn, recommends contextual vocabulary cards to the child. Through a two-week deployment study with 11 MVA child-parent dyads, we examine how AACessTalk fosters everyday conversation practice and mutual engagement. Our findings show high engagement from all dyads, leading to increased frequency of conversation and turn-taking. AACessTalk also encouraged parents to explore their own interaction strategies and empowered the children to have more agency in communication. We discuss the implications of designing technologies for balanced communication dynamics in parent-MVA child interaction.},

Our formative study revealed the challenges song-signers face, including semantic, syntactic, expressive, and rhythmic considerations in translations. We present ELMI, an accessible song-signing tool that assists in translating lyrics into sign language. ELMI enables users to edit glosses line-by-line, with real-time synced lyric and music video snippets. Users can also chat with a large language model-driven AI to discuss meaning, glossing, emoting, and timing. Through an exploratory study with 13 song-signers, we examined how ELMI facilitates their workflows and how song-signers leverage and receive an LLM-driven chat for translation. Participants successfully adopted ELMI to song-signing, with active discussions throughout. They also reported improved confidence and independence in their translations, finding ELMI encouraging, constructive, and informative. We discuss research and design implications for accessible and culturally sensitive song-signing translation tools.},

However, current systems often limit users’ flexibility to direct their reflections. We thus present ExploreSelf, an LLM-driven application designed to empower users to control their reflective journey, providing adaptive support through dynamically generated questions. Through an exploratory study with 19 participants, we examine how participants explore and reflect on personal challenges using ExploreSelf. Our findings demonstrate that participants valued the flexible navigation of adaptive guidance to control their reflective journey, leading to deeper engagement and insight. Building on our findings, we discuss the implications of designing LLM-driven tools that facilitate user-driven and effective reflection of personal challenges.},

            abstract = {Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer the potential for chatbots to support public health monitoring by automating tasks traditionally performed by frontline workers. While introducing AI impacts public agency workers across decision-making, administration, and monitoring roles, the perceptions of workers regarding these technologies and their actual impact on labor are underexplored. We examine the case of CareCall, a large language model (LLM)-driven chatbot used to monitor socially isolated individuals, by interviewing 21 public agency workers across 13 sites involved in its adoption and rollout. We find that CareCall helped expand public reach but increased burdens on frontline workers due to insufficient resources and new labor demands, such as handling lapses in user engagement. We discuss how implementing LLM-driven chatbots in public health contexts can complicate decision-makers’ articulation work and impose additional maintenance work on frontline workers. We recommend AI chatbots in this space leverage public infrastructure and incorporate fallback mechanisms.},

            abstract = {Communication with child patients is challenging due to their developing ability to express emotions and symptoms. Additionally, healthcare providers often have limited time to offer resources to parents. By leveraging AI to facilitate free-form conversations, our study aims to design an AI-driven chatbot to bridge these gaps in child-parent-provider communication. We conducted two studies: 1) design sessions with 12 children with cancer and their parents, which informed the development of our chatbot, ARCH, and 2) an interview study with 15 pediatric care experts to identify potential challenges and refine ARCH’s role in pediatric communication. Our findings highlight three key roles for ARCH: providing an expressive outlet for children, offering reassurance to parents, and serving as an assessment tool for providers. We conclude by discussing design considerations for AI-driven chatbots in pediatric communication, such as creating communication spaces, balancing the expectations of children and parents, and addressing potential cultural differences.},

            abstract = {We explore how interactions inspired by drawing software can help edit text. Making an analogy between visual and text editing, we consider words as pixels, sentences as regions, and tones as colours. For instance, direct manipulations move, shorten, expand, and reorder text; tools change number, tense, and grammar; colours map to tones explored along three dimensions in a tone picker; and layers help organize and version text. This analogy also leads to new workflows, such as boolean operations on text fragments to construct more elaborated text. A study shows participants were more successful at editing text and preferred using the proposed interface over existing solutions. Broadly, our work highlights the potential of interaction analogies to rethink existing workflows, while capitalizing on familiar features.},

We conducted a need finding study to gain insight into the writers’ process during creative writing through a qualitative analysis of the response from an online questionnaire and Reddit discussions on r/Writing. Using a systematic analysis of 115 tools and 67 research papers, we map out the landscape of how digital tools facilitate the writing process. Our triangulation of data reveals that research predominantly focuses on the writing activity and overlooks pre-writing activities and the importance of visualization. We distill 10 key takeaways to inform future research on WST and point to opportunities surrounding underexplored areas. Our work offers a holistic and up-to-date account of how tools have transformed the writing process, guiding the design of future tools that address writers’ evolving and unmet needs.},

            abstract = {In subjective decision-making, where decisions are based on contextual interpretation, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be integrated to present users with additional rationales to consider. The diversity of these rationales is mediated by the ability to consider the perspectives of different social actors; however, it remains unclear whether and how models differ in the distribution of perspectives they provide. We compare the perspectives taken by humans and different LLMs when assessing subtle sexism scenarios. We show that these perspectives can be classified within a finite set (perpetrator, victim, decision-maker), consistently present in argumentations produced by humans and LLMs, but in different distributions and combinations, demonstrating differences and similarities with human responses, and between models. We argue for the need to systematically evaluate LLMs’ perspective-taking to identify the most suitable models for a given decision-making task. We discuss the implications for model evaluation.},
