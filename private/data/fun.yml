            My research usually involve software prototypes (e.g., apps and webs) that are deployed and used by study participants.
            As a starting point of each research project, I design a logo or typeface for my research prototype. I use it for spash screens, icons, or even for presentation slides. I do it mostly for fun, but it also improves the originality and professionality of the design.

            Since I have a design background, during my PhD I was involved in a couple of branding projects for academic entities such as university departments and academic conferences. I designed identities, websites, posters, or proceeding books.

            I started 3D modelling since I was 14. I am also a big fan of robots like Transformers, and mechanical concepts like Steam Punk. Here are some old works that I did in the past. All designs are my original.
