<br/>
üìÖ Starting around January-June 2025, for 12 weeks + extendable up to additional 12 weeks

You will develop and execute research agenda that broadly touches **personal/health informatics systems (c.f., [link1](https://depstein.net/assets/docs/imwut20_slides.pdf), [link 2](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1753326.1753409)) equipped with AI and NLP technologies,** with methods including *(1) building and evaluating novel interactive systems and (2) obtaining empirical insights around existing technology or prototyped probes.*

**Sub-agenda with special interest include but are not limited to:**

1. Building personal health and well-being systems leveraging **multi-modal** (text/speech/image/...) understanding and generation of LLMs
2. LLM-infused visual exploration and sensemaking of **semi- or un-structured personal data** (e.g., photo+text journals, audio logs)
3. Advancing/understanding AIs in relation to **marginalized populations** (e.g., patients, children, older adults, people with disabilities) in the health and well-being context
4. Understanding how researchers and practitioners apply **Western-trained LLMs to non-Western populations**


An ideal outcome of the research internship is **to submit an academic paper to top-tier venues, such as CHI, UIST, UbiComp, and CSCW.**

All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply; however, **priority will given to citizens or permanent residents of Korea, as well as international students enrolled in Korean domestic universities.**
