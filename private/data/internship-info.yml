  hcigroup:
    The HCI group at NAVER AI Lab explores **how AI can support and enhance people's health and well-being**, with a particular focus on designing AI-infused systems that **account for and acknoledge the lifelong challenges of marginalized populations,** thereby extending the benefits of contemporary AI to a broader audience.

    title: 2025 Spring-Summer Research Internship
    content: >

      üè¢ In-person, NAVER Green Factory at Jeongja, Bundang, Seongnam, Gyunggi, South Korea
      <br/>
      üìÖ Starting around January-June 2025, for 12 weeks + extendable up to additional 12 weeks


      You will develop and execute research agenda that broadly touches **personal/health informatics systems (c.f., [link1](https://depstein.net/assets/docs/imwut20_slides.pdf), [link 2](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1753326.1753409)) equipped with AI and NLP technologies,** with methods including *(1) building and evaluating novel interactive systems and (2) obtaining empirical insights around existing technology or prototyped probes.*
      

      **Sub-agenda with special interest include but are not limited to:**
        1. Building personal health and well-being systems leveraging **multi-modal** (text/speech/image/...) understanding and generation of LLMs
        1. LLM-infused visual exploration and sensemaking of **semi- or un-structured personal data** (e.g., photo+text journals, audio logs)
        1. Advancing/understanding AIs in relation to **marginalized populations** (e.g., patients, children, older adults, people with disabilities) in the health and well-being context
        1. Understanding how researchers and practitioners apply **Western-trained LLMs to non-Western populations**


      An ideal outcome of the research internship is **to submit an academic paper to top-tier venues, such as CHI, UIST, UbiComp, and CSCW.**
      

      All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply; however, **priority will given to citizens or permanent residents of Korea, as well as international students enrolled in Korean domestic universities.**


      ### You are highly encouraged to meet these formal requirements:
        * Be pursuing a PhD or have received a Master's degree in Computer Science, Information Science, or other fields relevant to HCI. But if you are not in a PhD program, a track record of research would be necessary.
        * Have one or more <u>accepted</u> **full (main)** papers <u>as a sol-first author (co-first authored papers are not counted)</u> in **CHI**, **UIST**, **CSCW**, or **UbiComp**.
      
      ### We'll achieve the most synergy if you...
        * Are receptive to guidance and open to constructive feedback.
        * Are eager to learn and leverage new research methods, technoolgies, programming languages, libraries, etc., that will help us answer our research questions.

      ### I will try my best to help you...
        * Equip yourself with new research methods and skills.
        * Expand your research boundaries by integrating AI perspectives.
        * Experience hands-on collaboration in every aspect of research, including technical implementation, evaluation, analysis, and writing.
