Before joining NAVER, he worked as a postdoctoral associate at the Human-Computer Interaction Lab of the University of Maryland, College Park (2019-2021). Young-Ho is a Human-Computer Interaction researcher working at the intersection of Personal Health Informatics and Artificial Intelligence. Combining his multidisciplinary knowledge in Computer Science and Visual Communication Design, he designs, develops, and evaluates Personal Informatics (PI) technologies that empower people to better learn about themselves and make positive changes in their behaviors and thoughts. His recent research focus is on how to leverage (generative) AIs in PI systems to acknowledge and account for the lifelong challenges of marginalized populations. He has disseminated his research at prestigious HCI and Computer Science venues such as CHI, CSCW, UbiComp, VIS, and DIS.

Young-Ho received a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering (2012-2019) and a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Visual Communication Design (2007-2011) from Seoul National University. He is a recipient of a Best Paper award at ACM CHI 2023, and an Honorable Mention award at ACM CHI 2021. For more details, see his website at [https://younghokim.net](https://younghokim.net).
