  summary: |
    Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) technologies opens up exciting opportunities in the field of health and well-being.
    For example, conversational agents equipped with LLMs can capture various human behavioral information through open-ended and versatile dialogues.
    I am interested in building LLM-infused computing systems that support physical/mental health and well-being, and how we should leverage and audit LLMs to make them safely behave to the target users.

  summary: |
    Personal informatics systems require signficant human efforts in both collecting and exploring the data, 
    becuase the self-tracking process involves the user's personal context information, which is not recorded in the data.
    I explore ways to support such human-data interaction processes in flexible and less-structured manners, 
    to lower the barriers of lay individuals to novel self-tracking tools.
