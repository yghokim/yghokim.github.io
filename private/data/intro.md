I am a **Research Scientist** at <a href="https://clova.ai/ai-research" target="_blank" class="naver">NAVER AI Lab</a> at [NAVER Cloud](https://www.navercloudcorp.com/en/), leading the **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Research Group**. I design, develop, and evaluate Personal Informatics (PI) technologies that empower people to better learn about themselves and make positive changes in their behaviors and thoughts. Recently, I have investigated **how we can leverage (generative) AIs for PI systems to acknowledge and account for the lifelong challenges of marginalized populations.**

### Research Approaches
1. <b>Understand.</b> To deeply comprehend user needs and expert practice, I conduct formative interviews and focus groups with domain experts and target populations.

1. <b>Design.</b> Based on lessons learned from the formative study, I create engaging user experiences through hands-on design of visual interfaces, information architecture, and interaction patterns.

1. <b>Implement.</b> I develop high-fidelity working prototypes that translate the designs into functional systems. I code across platforms using appropriate technologies to create robust implementations that support real-world evaluations.

1. <b>Evaluate.</b> I evaluate the working prototypes through mixed-methods approaches including lab studies and in-the-wild deployments. My analysis combines qualitative techniques (thematic analysis) with quantitative measures to provide comprehensive insights into user experiences and system effectiveness.
